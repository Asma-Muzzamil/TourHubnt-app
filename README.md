This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

Project Overview
This project is a React Native application designed for tour packages, payments, bookings, registration, and sign-up functionalities. The application connects to a backend that was developed as part of a collaborative effort. The backend handles all the data management and API endpoints required by the app.

Backend Details
The backend was a single, unified service developed by me and a team member.
It manages all operations related to tour packages, payments, bookings, user registration, and authentication.
Important: The backend used in this project is not included in this repository, as it was designed for a one-time use during our project development.
Using Your Own Backend
Since the original backend is not included:

Set Up Your Backend:

You will need to create your own backend that provides the necessary API endpoints.
Your backend should be capable of handling requests for tour packages, payments, bookings, user registration, and authentication.
The original backend used MongoDB, so using MongoDB is recommended for managing the data.

Configure the API Endpoints:
Ensure that your API endpoints match the ones expected by the app.
Update the API URLs in the app to point to your local or deployed backend.


Limitations
This app was designed to work with a specific backend configuration. Without the appropriate backend, some features will not function.
This project does not include the original backend code, so it's necessary to develop or use your own backend to fully utilize the app.


Additional Notes
This project was developed as part of a collaborative Final Year Project (FYP) and was intended for demonstration purposes.
The backend is not included, and the provided app is mainly for showcasing the frontend work done using React Native.
